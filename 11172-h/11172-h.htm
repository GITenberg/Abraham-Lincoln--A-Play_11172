<p>NOTE</p>


<p>In using for purposes of drama a personality of so wide and recent a
fame as that of Abraham Lincoln, I feel that one or two observations are
due to my readers and critics.</p>

<p>First, my purpose is that not of the historian but of the dramatist. The
historical presentation of my hero has been faithfully made in many
volumes; notably, in England, by Lord Charnwood in a monograph that
gives a masterly analysis of Lincoln's career and character and is, it
seems to me, a model of what the historian's work should be. To this
book I am gratefully indebted for the material of my play. But while I
have, I hope, done nothing to traverse history, I have freely telescoped
its events, and imposed invention upon its movement, in such ways as I
needed to shape the dramatic significance of my subject. I should add
that the fictitious Burnet Hook is admitted to the historical company of
Lincoln's Cabinet for the purpose of embodying certain forces that were
antagonistic to the President. This was a dramatic necessity, and I
chose rather to invent a character for the purpose than to invest any
single known personage with sinister qualities about which there might
be dispute.</p>

<p>Secondly, my purpose is, again, that of the dramatist, not that of the
political philosopher. The issue of secession was a very intricate one,
upon which high and generous opinions may be in conflict, but that I may
happen to have or lack personal sympathy with Lincoln's policy and
judgment in this matter is nothing. My concern is with the profoundly
dramatic interest of his character, and with the inspiring example of a
man who handled war nobly and with imagination.</p>

<p>Finally, I am an Englishman, and not a citizen of the great country that
gave Lincoln birth. I have, therefore, written as an Englishman, making
no attempt to achieve a "local colour" of which I have no experience, or
to speak in an idiom to which I have not been bred. To have done
otherwise, as I am sure any American friends that this play may have the
good fortune to make will allow, would have been to treat a great
subject with levity.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>


<p>This play was originally produced by the Birmingham Repertory Theatre
last year, and it had a great success in Birmingham. But if its author
had not happened to be the artistic director of the Birmingham Repertory
Theatre the play might never have been produced there. The rumour of the
provincial success reached London, with the usual result&mdash;that London
managers magnificently ignored it. I have myself spoken with a very
well-known London actor-manager who admitted to me that he had refused
the play.</p>

<p>When Nigel Playfair, in conjunction with myself as a sort of Chancellor
of the Exchequer, started the Hammersmith Playhouse (for the
presentation of the best plays that could be got) we at once began to
inquire into the case of Abraham Lincoln. Nigel Playfair was absolutely
determined to have the play and the Birmingham company to act it. I read
the play and greatly admired it. We secured both the play and the
company. The first Hammersmith performance was a tremendous success,
both for the author of the play and for William J. Rea, the Irish actor
who in the rôle of Lincoln was merely great. The audience cried.</p>

<p>I should have cried myself, but for my iron resolve not to stain a
well-earned reputation for callousness. As I returned home that night
from what are known as "the wilds of Hammersmith" (Hammersmith is a
suburb of London) I said to myself: "This play is bound to succeed" The
next moment I said to myself: "This play cannot possibly succeed. It has
no love interest. It is a political play. Its theme is the threatened
separation of the Southern States from the Northern States. Nobody ever
heard of a play with such an absurd theme reaching permanent success. No
author before John Drinkwater ever had the effrontery to impose such a
theme on a London public."</p>

<p>My instinct was right and my reason was wrong. The play did succeed. It
is still succeeding, and it will continue to succeed. Nobody can dine
out in London to-day and admit without a blush that he has not seen
<b>Abraham Lincoln</b>. Monarchs and princes have seen it. Archbishops
have seen it. Statesmen without number have seen it. An ex-Lord
Chancellor told me that he had journeyed out into the said wilds and was
informed at the theatre that there were no seats left. He could not
believe that he would have to return from the wilds unsatisfied. But so
it fell out. West End managers have tried to coax the play from
Hammersmith to the West End. They could not do it. We have contrived to
make all London come to Hammersmith to see a play without a
love-interest or a bedroom scene, and the play will remain at
Hammersmith. Americans will more clearly realize what John Drinkwater
has achieved with the London public if they imagine somebody putting on
a play about the Crimean War at some unknown derelict theatre round
about Two Hundred and Fiftieth Street, and drawing all New York to Two
Hundred and Fiftieth Street.</p>

<p><b>Abraham Lincoln</b> has pleased everybody, and its triumph is the best
justification of those few who held that the public was capable of
liking much better plays than were offered to the public. Why has
<b>Abraham Lincoln</b> succeeded? Here are a few answers to the question:
Because the author had a deep, practical knowledge of the stage. Because
he disdained all stage tricks. Because he had the wit to select for his
hero one of the world's greatest and finest characters. Because he had
the audacity to select a gigantic theme and to handle it with
simplicity. Because he had the courage of all his artistic and moral
convictions. And of course because he has a genuine dramatic gift.
Finally, because William J. Rea plays Lincoln with the utmost nobility
of emotional power.</p>

<p>Every audience has the same experience at <b>Abraham Lincoln</b>, and I
laugh privately when I think of that experience. The curtain goes up on
a highly commonplace little parlour, and a few ordinary people chatting
in a highly commonplace manner. They keep on chatting. The audience
thinks to itself: "I've been done! What is this interminable small
talk?" And it wants to call out a protest: "Hi! You fellows on the
stage! Have you forgotten that there is an audience on the other side of
the footlights, waiting for something to happen?" (Truly the ordinary
people in the parlour do seem to be unaware of the existence of any
audience.) But wait, audience! Already the author is winding his chains
about you. Though you may not suspect it, you are already bound.... At
the end of the first scene the audience, vaguely feeling the spell,
wonders what on earth the nature of the spell is. At the end of the play
it is perhaps still wondering what precisely the nature of the spell
is.... But it fully and rapturously admits the reality of the spell.
Indeed after the fall of the curtain, and after many falls of the
curtain, the spell persists; the audience somehow cannot leave its
seats, and the thought of the worry of the journey home and of last
'busses and trains is banished. Strange phenomenon! It occurs every
night.</p>

<h2>ABRAHAM LINCOLN</h2>
<br>

<p><i>Two Chroniclers</i>:</p>

<pre><i>The two speaking together</i>: Kinsmen, you shall behold<br><br>
Our stage, in mimic action, mould <br><br>
A man's character.<br><br>
<br>
This is the wonder, always, everywhere&mdash;<br>
Not that vast mutability which is event,<br>
The pits and pinnacles of change,<br>
But man's desire and valiance that range<br>
All circumstance, and come to port unspent.<br>
<br>
Agents are these events, these ecstasies,<br>
And tribulations, to prove the purities<br>
Or poor oblivions that are our being. When<br>
Beauty and peace possess us, they are none<br>
But as they touch the beauty and peace of men,<br>
Nor, when our days are done,<br>
And the last utterance of doom must fall,<br>
Is the doom anything<br>
Memorable for its apparelling;<br>
The bearing of man facing it is all.<br>
<br>
So, kinsmen, we present<br>
This for no loud event<br>
That is but fugitive,<br>
But that you may behold<br>
Our mimic action mould<br>
The spirit of man immortally to live.<br>
<br>
<i>First Chronicler</i>: Once when a peril touched the days<br>
Of freedom in our English ways,<br>
And none renowned in government<br>
Was equal found,<br>
Came to the steadfast heart of one,<br>
Who watched in lonely Huntingdon,<br>
A summons, and he went,<br>
And tyranny was bound,<br>
And Cromwell was the lord of his event.<br>
<br>
<i>Second Chronicler</i>: And in that land where voyaging<br>
The pilgrim Mayflower came to rest,<br>
Among the chosen, counselling,<br>
<br>
Once, when bewilderment possessed<br>
A people, none there was might draw<br>
To fold the wandering thoughts of men,<br>
And make as one the names again<br>
Of liberty and law.<br>
<br>
And then, from fifty fameless years<br>
In quiet Illinois was sent<br>
A word that still the Atlantic hears,<br>
And Lincoln was the lord of his event.<br>
<br>
<i>The two speaking together:</i> So the uncounted<br>
    spirit wakes<br>
To the birth<br>
Of uncounted circumstance.<br>
And time in a generation makes<br>
Portents majestic a little story of earth<br>
To be remembered by chance<br>
At a fireside.<br>
But the ardours that they bear,<br>
The proud and invincible motions of<br>
  character&mdash;<br>
<br>
  These&mdash;these abide.<br>

</pre>


<p>SCENE I.</p>


<p><i>The parlour of Abraham Lincoln's House at Springfield, Illinois, early
in 1860</i>. MR. STONE, <i>a farmer, and</i> MR. CUFFNEY, <i>a store-keeper, both
men of between fifty and sixty, are sitting before an early spring fire.
It is dusk, but the curtains are not drawn. The men are smoking
silently</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone (after a pause)</i>: Abraham. It's a good name for a man to
bear, anyway.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney</i>: Yes. That's right.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone (after another pause)</i>: Abraham Lincoln. I've known him forty
years. Never crooked once. Well.</p>

<p><i>He taps his pipe reflectively on the grate. There is another pause</i>.
SUSAN, <i>a servant-maid, comes in, and busies herself lighting candles
and drawing the curtains to.</i></p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Mrs. Lincoln has just come in. She says she'll be here
directly.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney</i>: Thank you.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone</i>: Mr. Lincoln isn't home yet, I dare say?</p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> No, Mr. Stone. He won't be long, with all the gentlemen coming.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone:</i> How would you like your master to be President of the
United States, Susan?</p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> I'm sure he'd do it very nicely, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney:</i> He would have to leave Springfield, Susan, and go to live
in Washington.</p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> I dare say we should take to Washington very well, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney:</i> Ah! I'm glad to hear that.</p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> Mrs. Lincoln's rather particular about the tobacco smoke.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone:</i> To be sure, yes, thank you, Susan.</p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> The master doesn't smoke, you know. And Mrs. Lincoln's
specially particular about this room.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney:</i> Quite so. That's very considerate of you, Susan.</p>

<p><i>They knock out their pipes.</i></p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> Though some people might not hold with a gentleman not doing as
he'd a mind in his own house, as you might say.</p>

<p><i>She goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney (after a further pause, stroking his pipe)</i>: I suppose
there's no doubt about the message they'll bring?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone</i>: No, that's settled right enough. It'll be an invitation.
That's as sure as John Brown's dead.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney</i>: I could never make Abraham out rightly about old John.
One couldn't stomach slaving more than the other, yet Abraham didn't
hold with the old chap standing up against it with the sword. Bad
philosophy, or something, he called it. Talked about fanatics who do
nothing but get themselves at a rope's end.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone</i>: Abraham's all for the Constitution. He wants the
Constitution to be an honest master. There's nothing he wants like that,
and he'll stand for that, firm as a Samson of the spirit, if he goes to
Washington. He'd give his life to persuade the state against slaving,
but until it is persuaded and makes its laws against it, he'll have
nothing to do with violence in the name of laws that aren't made. That's
why old John's raiding affair stuck in his gullet.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney:</i> He was a brave man, going like that, with a few zealous
like himself, and a handful of niggers, to free thousands.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone:</i> He was. And those were brave words when they took him out
to hang him. "I think, my friends, you are guilty of a great wrong
against God and humanity. You may dispose of me very easily. I am nearly
disposed of now. But this question is still to be settled&mdash;this negro
question, I mean. The end of that is not yet." I was there that day.
Stonewall Jackson was there. He turned away. There was a colonel there
giving orders. When it was over, "So perish all foes of the human race,"
he called out. But only those that were afraid of losing their slaves
believed it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney (after a pause):</i> It was a bad thing to hang a man like
that. ... There's a song that they've made about him.</p>

<p><i>He sings quietly.</i></p>

<pre>  John Brown's body lies a mould'ring in the grave,<br>
  But his soul goes marching on...<br>
</pre>

<p><i>Mr. Stone:</i> I know.</p>

<p><i>The two together (singing quietly):</i></p>

<pre>The stars of heaven are looking kindly down<br>
  On the grave of old John Brown....<br>
</pre>

<p><i>After a moment</i> MRS. LINCOLN <i>comes in. The men rise.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> Good-evening, Mr. Stone. Good-evening, Mr. Cuffney.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone and Mr. Cuffney:</i> Good-evening, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> Sit down, if you please.</p>

<p><i>They all sit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone:</i> This is a great evening for you, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> It is.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney:</i> What time do you expect the deputation, ma'am?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> They should be here at seven o'clock. <i>(With an
inquisitive nose.)</i> Surely, Abraham hasn't been smoking.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone (rising):</i> Shall I open the window, ma'am? It gets close of
an evening.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> Naturally, in March. You may leave the window, Samuel
Stone. We do not smoke in the parlour.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone (resuming his seat):</i> By no means, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> I shall be obliged to you.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney:</i> Has Abraham decided what he will say to the invitation?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> He will accept it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone:</i> A very right decision, if I may say so.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> It is.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney:</i> And you, ma'am, have advised him that way, I'll be bound.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> You said this was a great evening for me. It is, and
I'll say more than I mostly do, because it is. I'm likely to go into
history now with a great man. For I know better than any how great he
is. I'm plain looking and I've a sharp tongue, and I've a mind that
doesn't always go in his easy, high way. And that's what history will
see, and it will laugh a little, and say, "Poor Abraham Lincoln." That's
all right, but it's not all. I've always known when he should go
forward, and when he should hold back. I've watched, and watched, and
what I've learnt America will profit by. There are women like that, lots
of them. But I'm lucky. My work's going farther than Illinois&mdash;it's
going farther than any of us can tell. I made things easy for him to
think and think when we were poor, and now his thinking has brought him
to this. They wanted to make him Governor of Oregon, and he would have
gone and have come to nothing there. I stopped him. Now they're coming
to ask him to be President, and I've told him to go.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone</i>: If you please, ma'am, I should like to apologise for
smoking in here.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: That's no matter, Samuel Stone. Only, don't do it again.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney</i>: It's a great place for a man to fill. Do you know how
Seward takes Abraham's nomination by the Republicans?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: Seward is ambitious. He expected the nomination. Abraham
will know how to use him.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone</i>: The split among the Democrats makes the election of the
Republican choice a certainty, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: Abraham says so.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney</i>: You know, it's hard to believe. When I think of the times
I've sat in this room of an evening, and seen your husband come in,
ma'am, with his battered hat nigh falling off the back of his head, and
stuffed with papers that won't go into his pockets, and god-darning some
rascal who'd done him about an assignment or a trespass, I can't think
he's going up there into the eyes of the world.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: I've tried for years to make him buy a new hat.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney</i>: I have a very large selection just in from New York.
Perhaps Abraham might allow me to offer him one for his departure.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: He might. But he'll wear the old one.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone</i>: Slavery and the South. They're big things he'll have to
deal with. "The end of that is not yet." That's what old John Brown
said, "the end of that is not yet."</p>

<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN <i>comes in, a greenish and crumpled top hat leaving his
forehead well uncovered, his wide pockets brimming over with documents.
He is fifty, and he still preserves his clean-shaven state. He kisses
his wife and shakes hands with his friends.</i></p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Well, Mary. How d'ye do, Samuel. How d'ye do, Timothy.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone and Mr. Cuffney:</i> Good-evening, Abraham.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (while he takes of his hat and shakes out sundry papers from
the lining into a drawer):</i> John Brown, did you say? Aye, John Brown.
But that's not the way it's to be done. And you can't do the right thing
the wrong way. That's as bad as the wrong thing, if you're going to keep
the state together.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney:</i> Well, we'll be going. We only came in to give you
good-faring, so to say, in the great word you've got to speak this
evening.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone:</i> It makes a humble body almost afraid of himself, Abraham,
to know his friend is to be one of the great ones of the earth, with his
yes and no law for these many, many thousands of folk.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> It makes a man humble to be chosen so, Samuel. So humble that
no man but would say "No" to such bidding if he dare. To be President of
this people, and trouble gathering everywhere in men's hearts. That's a
searching thing. Bitterness, and scorn, and wrestling often with men I
shall despise, and perhaps nothing truly done at the end. But I must go.
Yes. Thank you, Samuel; thank you, Timothy. Just a glass of that
cordial, Mary, before they leave.</p>

<p><i>He goes to a cupboard.</i></p>

<p>May the devil smudge that girl!</p>

<p><i>Calling at the door.</i></p>

<p>Susan! Susan Deddington! Where's that darnation cordial?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> It's all right, Abraham. I told the girl to keep it out.
The cupboard's choked with papers.</p>

<p><i>Susan (coming in with bottle and glasses):</i> I'm sure I'm sorry. I was
told&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> All right, all right, Susan. Get along with you.</p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> Thank you, sir. <i>She goes.</i></p>

<p><i>Lincoln (pouring out drink):</i> Poor hospitality for whiskey-drinking
rascals like yourselves. But the thought's good.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone:</i> Don't mention it, Abraham.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney:</i> We wish you well, Abraham. Our compliments, ma'am. And
God bless America! Samuel, I give you the United States, and Abraham
Lincoln.</p>

<p>MR. CUFFNEY <i>and</i> MR. STONE <i>drink.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> Thank you.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Samuel, Timothy&mdash;I drink to the hope of honest friends. Mary,
to friendship. I'll need that always, for I've a queer, anxious heart.
And, God bless America!</p>

<p><i>He and</i> MRS. LINCOLN <i>drink.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone:</i> Well, good-night, Abraham. Goodnight, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cuffney:</i> Good-night, good-night.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> Good-night, Mr. Stone. Good-night, Mr. Cuffney.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Good-night, Samuel. Good-night, Timothy. And thank you for
coming.</p>

<p>MR. STONE <i>and</i> MR. CUFFNEY <i>go out.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> You'd better see them in here.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Good. Five minutes to seven. You're sure about it, Mary?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> Yes. Aren't you?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> We mean to set bounds to slavery. The South will resist. They
may try to break away from the Union. That cannot be allowed. If the
Union is set aside America will crumble. The saving of it may mean
blood.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> Who is to shape it all if you don't?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> There's nobody. I know it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> Then go.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Go.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln (after a moment):</i> This hat is a disgrace to you, Abraham.
You pay no heed to what I say, and you think it doesn't matter. A man
like you ought to think a little about gentility.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> To be sure. I forget.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> You don't. You just don't heed. Samuel Stone's been
smoking in here.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> He's a careless, poor fellow.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> He is, and a fine example you set him. You don't care
whether he makes my parlour smell poison or not.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Of course I do&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> You don't. Your head is too stuffed with things to think
about my ways. I've got neighbours if you haven't.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Well, now, your neighbours are mine, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> Then why won't you consider appearances a little?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Certainly. I must.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> Will you get a new hat?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Yes, I must see about it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> When?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> In a day or two. Before long.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> Abraham, I've got a better temper than anybody will ever
guess.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> You have, my dear. And you need it, I confess.</p>

<p>SUSAN <i>comes in.</i></p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> The gentlemen have come.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> I'll come to them.</p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> Does the master want a handkerchief, ma'am? He didn't take one
this morning.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> It's no matter now, Susan.</p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> If you please, I've brought you one, sir.</p>

<p><i>She gives it to him, and goes.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln:</i> I'll send them in. Abraham, I believe in you.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> I know, I know.</p>

<p>MRS. LINCOLN <i>goes out.</i> LINCOLN <i>moves to a map of the United States
that is hanging on the wall, and stands silently looking at it. After a
few moments</i> SUSAN <i>comes to the door.</i></p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> This way, please.</p>

<p><i>She shows in</i> WILLIAM TUCKER, <i>a florid, prosperous merchant;</i> HENRY
HIND, <i>an alert little attorney;</i> ELIAS PRICE, <i>a lean lay preacher;
and</i> JAMES MACINTOSH, <i>the editor of a Republican journal.</i> SUSAN <i>goes.</i></p>

<p><i>Tucker:</i> Mr. Lincoln. Tucker my name is&mdash;William Tucker.</p>

<p><i>He presents his companions.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Henry Hind&mdash;follows your profession, Mr. Lincoln. Leader of the bar
in Ohio. Mr. Elias Price, of Pennsylvania. You've heard him preach,
maybe. James Macintosh you know. I come from Chicago.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Gentlemen, at your service. How d'ye do, James. Will you be
seated?</p>

<p><i>They sit round the table.</i></p>

<p><i>Tucker</i>: I have the honour to be chairman of this delegation. We are
sent from Chicago by the Republican Convention, to enquire whether you
will accept their invitation to become the Republican candidate for the
office of President of the United States.</p>

<p><i>Price</i>: The Convention is aware, Mr. Lincoln, that under the
circumstances, seeing that the Democrats have split, this is more than
an invitation to candidature. Their nominee is almost certain to be
elected.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Gentlemen, I am known to one of you only. Do you know my many
disqualifications for this work?</p>

<p><i>Hind</i>: It's only fair to say that they have been discussed freely.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: There are some, shall we say graces, that I lack. Washington
does not altogether neglect these.</p>

<p><i>Tucker</i>: They have been spoken of. But these are days, Mr. Lincoln, if
I may say so, too difficult, too dangerous, for these to weigh at the
expense of other qualities that you were considered to possess.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Seward and Hook have both had great experience.</p>

<p><i>Macintosh</i>: Hook had no strong support. For Seward, there are doubts as
to his discretion.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Do not be under any misunderstanding, I beg you. I aim at
moderation so far as it is honest. But I am a very stubborn man,
gentlemen. If the South insists upon the extension of slavery, and
claims the right to secede, as you know it very well may do, and the
decision lies with me, it will mean resistance, inexorable, with blood
if needs be. I would have everybody's mind clear as to that.</p>

<p><i>Price</i>: It will be for you to decide, and we believe you to be an
upright man, Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Seward and Hook would be difficult to carry as subordinates.</p>

<p><i>Tucker</i>: But they will have to be carried so, and there's none likelier
for the job than you.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Will your Republican Press stand by me for a principle,
James, whatever comes?</p>

<p><i>Macintosh</i>: There's no other man we would follow so readily.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: If you send me, the South will have little but derision for
your choice.</p>

<p><i>Hind</i>: We believe that you'll last out their laughter.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I can take any man's ridicule&mdash;I'm trained to it by a ...
somewhat odd figure that it pleased God to give me, if I may so far be
pleasant with you. But this slavery business will be long, and deep, and
bitter. I know it. If you do me this honour, gentlemen, you must look to
me for no compromise in this matter. If abolition comes in due time by
constitutional means, good. I want it. But, while we will not force
abolition, we will give slavery no approval, and we will not allow it to
extend its boundaries by one yard. The determination is in my blood.
When I was a boy I made a trip to New Orleans, and there I saw them,
chained, beaten, kicked as a man would be ashamed to kick a thieving
dog. And I saw a young girl driven up and down the room that the bidders
might satisfy themselves. And I said then, "If ever I get a chance to
hit that thing, I'll hit it hard."</p>

<p><i>A pause</i>.</p>

<p>You have no conditions to make?</p>

<p><i>Tucker</i>: None.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (rising):</i> Mrs. Lincoln and I would wish you to take supper
with us.</p>

<p><i>Tucker</i>: That's very kind, I'm sure. And your answer, Mr. Lincoln?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: When you came, you did not know me, Mr. Tucker. You may have
something to say now not for my ears.</p>

<p><i>Tucker</i>: Nothing in the world, I assure&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I will prepare Mrs. Lincoln. You will excuse me for no more
than a minute.</p>

<p><i>He goes out</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tucker</i>: Well, we might have chosen a handsomer article, but I doubt
whether we could have chosen a better.</p>

<p><i>Hind</i>: He would make a great judge&mdash;if you weren't prosecuting.</p>

<p><i>Price</i>: I'd tell most people, but I'd ask that man.</p>

<p><i>Tucker</i>: He hasn't given us yes or no yet. Why should he leave us like
that, as though plain wasn't plain?</p>

<p><i>Hind</i>: Perhaps he wanted a thought by himself first.</p>

<p><i>Macintosh</i>: It wasn't that. But he was right. Abraham Lincoln sees
deeper into men's hearts than most. He knows this day will be a memory
to us all our lives. Under his eye, which of you could have given play
to any untoward thought that had started in you against him since you
came into this room? But, leaving you, he knew you could test yourselves
to your own ease, and speak the more confident for it, and, if you found
yourselves clean of doubt, carry it all the happier in your minds after.
Is there a doubt among us?</p>

<p><i>Macintosh</i>: Then, Mr. Tucker, ask him again when he comes back.</p>

<p><i>Tucker</i>: I will.</p>

<p><i>They sit in silence for a moment, and</i> Lincoln <i>comes in again, back to
his place at the table</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I wouldn't have you think it graceless of me to be slow in my
answer. But once given, it's for the deep good or the deep ill of all
this country. In the face of that a man may well ask himself twenty
times, when he's twenty times sure. You make no qualification, any one
among you?</p>

<p><i>Tucker</i>: None. The invitation is as I put it when we sat down. And I
would add that we are, all of us, proud to bear it to a man as to whom
we feel there is none so fitted to receive it.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I thank you. I accept.</p>

<p><i>He rises, the others with him. He goes to the door and calls</i>.</p>

<p>Susan.</p>

<p><i>There is silence</i>. SUSAN <i>comes in.</i></p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> Yes, Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Take these gentlemen to Mrs. Lincoln. I will follow at once.</p>

<p><i>The four men go with</i> SUSAN. LINCOLN <i>stands silently for a moment. He
goes again to the map and looks at it. He then turns to the table again,
and kneels beside it, possessed and deliberate, burying his face in his
hands.</i></p>

<p>SCENE II.</p>

<p><i>Ten months later. Seward's room at Washington</i>. WILLIAM H. SEWARD,
<i>Secretary of State, is seated at his table with</i> JOHNSON WHITE <i>and</i>
CALEB JENNINGS, <i>representing the Commissioners of the Confederate
States</i>.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: It's the common feeling in the South, Mr. Seward, that you're
the one man at Washington to see this thing with large imagination. I
say this with no disrespect to the President.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: I appreciate your kindness, Mr. White. But the Union is the
Union&mdash;you can't get over that. We are faced with a plain fact. Seven of
the Southern States have already declared for secession. The President
feels&mdash;and I may say that I and my colleagues are with him&mdash;that to
break up the country like that means the decline of America.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: But everything might be done by compromise, Mr. Seward.
Withdraw your garrison from Fort Sumter, Beauregard will be instructed
to take no further action, South Carolina will be satisfied with the
recognition of her authority, and, as likely as not, be willing to give
the lead to the other states in reconsidering secession.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: It is certainly a very attractive and, I conceive, a humane
proposal.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: By furthering it you might be the saviour of the country from
civil war, Mr. Seward.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: The President dwelt on his resolution to hold Fort Sumter in
his inaugural address. It will be difficult to persuade him to go back
on that. He's firm in his decisions.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: There are people who would call him stubborn. Surely if it were
put to him tactfully that so simple a course might avert incalculable
disaster, no man would nurse his dignity to the point of not yielding. I
speak plainly, but it's a time for plain speaking. Mr. Lincoln is
doubtless a man of remarkable qualities: on the two occasions when I
have spoken to him I have not been unimpressed. That is so, Mr.
Jennings?</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: Certainly.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: But what does his experience of great affairs of state amount
to beside yours, Mr. Seward? He must know how much he depends on certain
members of his Cabinet, I might say upon a certain member, for advice.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: We have to move warily.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: Naturally. A man is sensitive, doubtless, in his first taste
of office.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: My support of the President is, of course, unquestionable.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: Oh, entirely. But how can your support be more valuable than in
lending him your unequalled understanding?</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: The whole thing is coloured in his mind by the question of
slavery.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: Disabuse his mind. Slavery is nothing. Persuade him to
withdraw from Fort Sumter, and slavery can be settled round a table. You
know there's a considerable support even for abolition in the South
itself. If the trade has to be allowed in some districts, what is that
compared to the disaster of civil war?</p>

<p><i>White</i>: We do not believe that the Southern States wish with any
enthusiasm to secede. They merely wish to establish their right to do
so. Acknowledge that by evacuating Fort Sumter, and nothing will come of
it but a perfectly proper concession to an independence of spirit that
is not disloyal to the Union at heart.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: You understand, of course, that I can say nothing officially.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: These are nothing but informal suggestions.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: But I may tell you that I am not unsympathetic.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: We were sure that that would be so.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: And my word is not without influence.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: It can be used to bring you very great credit, Mr. Seward.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: In the mean time, you will say nothing of this interview,
beyond making your reports, which should be confidential.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: You may rely upon us.</p>

<p><i>Seward (rising with the others)</i>: Then I will bid you good-morning.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: We are profoundly sensible of the magnanimous temper in which
we are convinced you will conduct this grave business. Good-morning, Mr.
Seward.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: And I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>There is a knock at the door</i>.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Yes&mdash;come in.</p>

<p>A CLERK <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i>: The President is coming up the stairs, sir.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Thank you.</p>

<p>THE CLERK <i>goes</i>. This is unfortunate. Say nothing, and go at once.</p>

<p>LINCOLN <i>comes in, now whiskered and bearded.</i></p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Good-morning, Mr. Seward. Good-morning, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Good-morning, Mr. President. And I am obliged to you for
calling, gentlemen. Good-morning.</p>

<p><i>He moves towards the door</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Perhaps these gentlemen could spare me ten minutes.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: It might not&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Say five minutes.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: Perhaps you would&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I am anxious always for any opportunity to exchange views
with our friends of the South. Much enlightenment may be gained in five
minutes. Be seated, I beg you&mdash;if Mr. Seward will allow us.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: By all means. Shall I leave you?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Leave us&mdash;but why? I may want your support, Mr. Secretary, if
we should not wholly agree. Be seated, gentlemen.</p>

<p>SEWARD <i>places a chair for</i> LINCOLN, <i>and they sit at the table</i>.</p>

<p>You have messages for us?</p>

<p><i>White</i>: Well, no, we can't say that.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: No messages? Perhaps I am inquisitive?</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: These gentlemen are anxious to sound any moderating
influences.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I trust they bring moderating influences with them. You will
find me a ready listener, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: It's a delicate matter, Mr. Lincoln. Ours is just an
informal visit.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Quite, quite. But we shall lose nothing by knowing each
other's minds.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: Shall we tell the President what we came to say, Mr. Seward?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I shall be grateful. If I should fail to understand, Mr.
Seward, no doubt, will enlighten me.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: We thought it hardly worth while to trouble you at so early
a stage.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: So early a stage of what?</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: I mean&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: These gentlemen, in a common anxiety for peace, were merely
seeking the best channel through which suggestions could be made.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: To whom?</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: To the government.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: The head of the government is here.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: But&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Come, gentlemen. What is it?</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: It's this matter of Fort Sumter, Mr. President. If you
withdraw your garrison from Fort Sumter it won't be looked upon as
weakness in you. It will merely be looked upon as a concession to a
natural privilege. We believe that the South at heart does not want
secession. It wants to establish the right to decide for itself.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: The South wants the stamp of national approval upon slavery.
It can't have it.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: Surely that's not the point. There's no law in the South
against slavery.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Laws come from opinion, Mr. White. The South knows it.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: Mr. President, if I may say so, you don't quite understand.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Does Mr. Seward understand?</p>

<p><i>White</i>: We believe so.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You are wrong. He doesn't understand, because you didn't mean
him to. I don't blame you. You think you are acting for the best. You
think you've got an honest case. But I'll put your case for you, and
I'll put it naked. Many people in this country want abolition; many
don't. I'll say nothing for the moment as to the rights and wrongs of
it. But every man, whether he wants it or not, knows it may come. Why
does the South propose secession? Because it knows abolition may come,
and it wants to avoid it. It wants more: it wants the right to extend
the slave foundation. We've all been to blame for slavery, but we in the
North have been willing to mend our ways. You have not. So you'll
secede, and make your own laws. But you weren't prepared for resistance;
you don't want resistance. And you hope that if you can tide over the
first crisis and make us give way, opinion will prevent us from opposing
you with force again, and you'll be able to get your own way about the
slave business by threats. That's your case. You didn't say so to Mr.
Seward, but it is. Now, I'll give you my answer. Gentlemen, it's no good
hiding this thing in a corner. It's got to be settled. I said the other
day that Fort Sumter would be held as long as we could hold it. I said
it because I know exactly what it means. Why are you investing it? Say,
if you like, it's to establish your right of secession with no purpose
of exercising it. Why do you want to establish that right? Because now
we will allow no extension of slavery, and because some day we may
abolish it. You can't deny it; there's no other answer.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: I see how it is. You may force freedom as much as you like,
but we are to beware how we force slavery.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: It couldn't be put better, Mr. Jennings. That's what the
Union means. It is a Union that stands for common right. That is its
foundation&mdash;that is why it is for every honest man to preserve it. Be
clear about this issue. If there is war, it will not be on the slave
question. If the South is loyal to the Union, it can fight slave
legislation by constitutional means, and win its way if it can. If it
claims the right to secede, then to preserve this country from
disruption, to maintain that right to which every state pledged itself
when the Union was won for us by our fathers, war may be the only way.
We won't break up the Union, and you shan't. In your hands, and not in
mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. You can have no conflict
without yourselves being the aggressors. I am loath to close. We are not
enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have
strained, do not allow it to break our bonds of affection. That is our
answer. Tell them that. Will you tell them that?</p>

<p><i>White</i>: You are determined?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I beg you to tell them.</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: It shall be as you wish.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Implore them to order Beauregard's return. You can telegraph
it now, from here. Will you do that?</p>

<p><i>White</i>: If you wish it.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Earnestly. Mr. Seward, will you please place a clerk at their
service. Ask for an answer.</p>

<p>SEWARD <i>rings a bell</i>. A CLERK <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Seward:</i> Give these gentlemen a private wire. Place yourself at their
disposal.</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p>WHITE <i>and</i> JENNINGS <i>go out with the</i> CLERK. <i>For a moment</i> LINCOLN
<i>and</i> SEWARD <i>are silent,</i> LINCOLN <i>pacing the room</i>, SEWARD <i>standing
at the table.</i></p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Seward, this won't do.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: You don't suspect&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I do not. But let us be plain. No man can say how wisely, but
Providence has brought me to the leadership of this country, with a task
before me greater than that which rested on Washington himself. When I
made my Cabinet, you were the first man I chose. I do not regret it. I
think I never shall. But remember, faith earns faith. What is it? Why
didn't those men come to see me?</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: They thought my word might bear more weight with you than
theirs.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Your word for what?</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Discretion about Fort Sumter.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Discretion?</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: It's devastating, this thought of war.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: It is. Do you think I'm less sensible of that than you? War
should be impossible. But you can only make it impossible by destroying
its causes. Don't you see that to withdraw from Fort Sumter is to do
nothing of the kind? If one half of this country claims the right to
disown the Union, the claim in the eyes of every true guardian among us
must be a cause for war, unless we hold the Union to be a false thing
instead of the public consent to decent principles of life that it is.
If we withdraw from Fort Sumter, we do nothing to destroy that cause. We
can only destroy it by convincing them that secession is a betrayal of
their trust. Please God we may do so.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Has there, perhaps, been some timidity in making all this
clear to the country?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Timidity? And you were talking of discretion.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: I mean that perhaps our policy has not been sufficiently
defined.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: And have you not concurred in all our decisions? Do not
deceive yourself. You urge me to discretion in one breath and tax me
with timidity in the next. While there was hope that they might call
Beauregard back out of their own good sense, I was determined to say
nothing to inflame them. Do you call that timidity? Now their intention
is clear, and you've heard me speak this morning clearly also. And now
you talk about discretion&mdash;you, who call what was discretion at the
right time, timidity, now counsel timidity at the wrong time, and call
it discretion. Seward, you may think I'm simple, but I can see your mind
working as plainly as you might see the innards of a clock. You can
bring great gifts to this government, with your zeal, and your
administrative experience, and your love of men. Don't spoil it by
thinking I've got a dull brain.</p>

<p><i>Seward (slowly):</i> Yes, I see. I've not been thinking quite clearly
about it all.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (taking a paper from his pocket</i>): Here's the paper you sent
me. "Some Thoughts for the President's Consideration. Great Britain ...
Russia ... Mexico ... policy. Either the President must control this
himself, or devolve it on some member of his Cabinet. It is not in my
especial province, but I neither seek to evade nor assume
responsibility."</p>

<p><i>There is a pause, the two men looking at each, other without speaking</i>.
LINCOLN <i>hands the paper to</i> SEWARD, <i>who holds it for a moment, tears
it up and throws it into his basket</i>.</p>

<p><i>Seward:</i> I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (taking his hand</i>): That's brave of you.</p>

<p>JOHN HAY, <i>a Secretary, comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hay:</i> There's a messenger from Major Anderson, sir. He's ridden
straight from Fort Sumter.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Take him to my room. No, bring him here.</p>

<p>HAY <i>goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: What does it mean?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I don't like the sound of it.</p>

<p><i>He rings a bell</i>. A CLERK <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p>Are there any gentlemen of the Cabinet in the house?</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i>: Mr. Chase and Mr. Blair, I believe, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: My compliments to them, and will they be prepared to see me
here at once if necessary. Send the same message to any other ministers
you can find.</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>He goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: We may have to decide now&mdash;now.</p>

<p>HAY <i>shows in a perspiring and dust-covered</i></p>

<p>MESSENGER, <i>and retires</i>. From Major Anderson?</p>

<p><i>The Messenger</i>: Yes, sir. Word of mouth, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Your credentials?</p>

<p><i>The Messenger (giving</i> LINCOLN <i>a paper</i>): Here, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (glancing at it</i>): Well?</p>

<p><i>The Messenger</i>: Major Anderson presents his duty to the government. He
can hold the Fort three days more without provisions and reinforcements.</p>

<p>LINCOLN <i>rings the bell, and waits until a third</i> CLERK <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: See if Mr. White and Mr. Jennings have had any answer yet.
Mr.&mdash;what's his name?</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Hawkins.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Mr. Hawkins is attending to them. And ask Mr. Hay to come
here.</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>He goes</i>. LINCOLN <i>sits at the table and writes</i>. HAY <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (writing):</i> Mr. Hay, do you know where General Scott is?</p>

<p><i>Hay</i>: At headquarters, I think, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Take this to him yourself and bring an answer back.</p>

<p><i>Hay</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>He takes the note, and goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Are things very bad at the Fort?</p>

<p><i>The Messenger</i>: The major says three days, sir. Most of us would have
said twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><i>A knock at the door</i>.</p>

<p><i>Seward:</i> Yes.</p>

<p>HAWKINS <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hawkins</i>: Mr. White is just receiving a message across the wire, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Ask him to come here directly he's finished.</p>

<p><i>Hawkins</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>He goes</i>. LINCOLN <i>goes to a far door and opens it. He speaks to the</i>
MESSENGER.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Will you wait in here?</p>

<p><i>The</i> MESSENGER <i>goes through</i>.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Do you mind if I smoke?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Not at all, not at all.</p>

<p>SEWARD <i>lights a cigar</i>.</p>

<p>Three days. If White's message doesn't help us&mdash;three days.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: But surely we must withdraw as a matter of military necessity
now.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Why doesn't White come?</p>

<p>SEWARD <i>goes to the window and throws it up. He stands looking down into
the street</i>. LINCOLN <i>stands at the table looking fixedly at the door.
After a moment or two there is a knock.</i></p>

<p>Come in.</p>

<p>HAWKINS <i>shows in</i> WHITE <i>and</i> JENNINGS, <i>and goes out</i>. SEWARD <i>closes
the window</i>.</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p><i>White</i>: I'm sorry. They won't give way.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You told them all I said?</p>

<p><i>Jennings</i>: Everything.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: It's critical.</p>

<p><i>White</i>: They are definite.</p>

<p>LINCOLN <i>paces once or twice up and down the room, standing again at his
place at the table</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> They leave no opening?</p>

<p><i>White</i>: I regret to say, none.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: It's a grave decision. Terribly grave. Thank you, gentlemen.
Good-morning.</p>

<p><i>White and Jennings</i>: Good-morning, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>They go out</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: My God! Seward, we need great courage, great faith.</p>

<p><i>He rings the bell. The</i> SECOND CLERK <i>comes in.</i></p>

<p>Did you take my messages?</p>

<p><i>The Clerk</i>: Yes, sir. Mr. Chase and Mr. Blair are here. The other
ministers are coming immediately.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Ask them to come here at once. And send Mr. Hay in directly
he returns.</p>

<p><i>The Clerk</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>He goes</i>.</p>


<p><i>Lincoln (after a pause</i>): "There is a tide in the affairs of men ..."
Do you read Shakespeare, Seward?</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Shakespeare? No.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Ah!</p>

<p>SALMON P. CHASE, <i>Secretary of the Treasury, and</i> MONTGOMERY BLAIR,
<i>Postmaster-General, come in</i>.</p>

<p>Good-morning, Mr. Chase, Mr. Blair.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Good-morning, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Blair</i>: Good-morning, Mr. President. How d'ye do, Mr. Seward.</p>

<p><i>Chase</i>: Good-morning, Mr. President. Something urgent?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Let us be seated.</p>

<p><i>As they draw chairs up to the table, the other members of the Cabinet</i>,
SIMON CAMERON, CALEB SMITH, BURNET HOOK, <i>and</i> GIDEON WELLES, <i>come in.
There is an exchange of greetings, while they arrange themselves round
the table</i>.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, we meet in a crisis, the most fateful, perhaps, that has ever
faced any government in this country. It can be stated briefly. A
message has just come from Anderson. He can hold Fort Sumter three days
at most unless we send men and provisions.</p>

<p><i>Cameron</i>: How many men?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I shall know from Scott in a few minutes how many are
necessary.</p>

<p><i>Welles</i>: Suppose we haven't as many.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Then it's a question of provisioning. We may not be able to
do enough to be effective. The question is whether we shall do as much
as we can.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: If we withdrew altogether, wouldn't it give the South a lead
towards compromise, as being an acknowledgment of their authority, while
leaving us free to plead military necessity if we found public opinion
dangerous?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: My mind is clear. To do less than we can do, whatever that
may be, will be fundamentally to allow the South's claim to right of
secession. That is my opinion. If you evade the question now, you will
have to answer it tomorrow.</p>

<p><i>Blair</i>: I agree with the President.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: We ought to defer action as long as possible. I consider that we
should withdraw.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Don't you see that to withdraw may postpone war, but that it
will make it inevitable in the end?</p>

<p><i>Smith</i>: It is inevitable if we resist.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I fear it will be so. But in that case we shall enter it with
uncompromised principles. Mr. Chase?</p>

<p><i>Chase</i>: It is difficult. But, on the whole, my opinion is with yours,
Mr. President.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: And you, Seward?</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: I respect your opinion, but I must differ.</p>

<p><i>A knock at the door</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Come in.</p>

<p>HAY <i>comes in. He gives a letter to</i> LINCOLN <i>and goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>(Reading):</i> Scott says twenty thousand men.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: We haven't ten thousand ready.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: It remains a question of sending provisions. I charge you,
all of you, to weigh this thing with all your understanding. To
temporise now, cannot, in my opinion, avert war. To speak plainly to the
world in standing by our resolution to hold Fort Sumter with all our
means, and in a plain declaration that the Union must be preserved, will
leave us with a clean cause, simply and loyally supported. I tremble at
the thought of war. But we have in our hands a sacred trust. It is
threatened. We have had no thought of aggression. We have been the
aggressed. Persuasion has failed, and I conceive it to be our duty to
resist. To withhold supplies from Anderson would be to deny that duty.
Gentlemen, the matter is before you.</p>

<p><i>A pause</i>.</p>

<p>For provisioning the fort?</p>

<p>LINCOLN, CHASE, <i>and</i> BLAIR <i>hold up their hands.</i></p>

<p>For immediate withdrawal?</p>

<p>SEWARD, CAMERON, SMITH, HOOK, <i>and</i> WELLES <i>hold up their hands. There
is a pause of some moments</i>.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I may have to take upon myself the responsibility of
over-riding your vote. It will be for me to satisfy Congress and public
opinion. Should I receive any resignations?</p>

<p><i>There is silence</i>.</p>

<p>I thank you for your consideration, gentlemen. That is all.</p>

<p><i>They rise, and the Ministers, with the exception of</i> SEWARD, <i>go out,
talking as they pass beyond the door</i>.</p>

<p>You are wrong, Seward, wrong.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: I believe you. I respect your judgment even as far as that.
But I must speak as I feel.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: May I speak to this man alone?</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Certainly. <i>He goes out</i>. LINCOLN <i>stands motionless for a
moment. Then he moves to a map of the United States, much larger than
the one in his Illinois home, and looks at it as he did there. He goes
to the far door and opens it</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Will you come in?</p>

<p><i>The</i> MESSENGER <i>comes</i>.</p>

<p>Can you ride back to Major Anderson at once?</p>

<p><i>The Messenger</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Tell him that we cannot reinforce him immediately. We haven't
the men.</p>

<p><i>The Messenger</i>: Yes, sir.</p>


<p><i>Lincoln</i>: And say that the first convoy of supplies will leave
Washington this evening.</p>

<p><i>The Messenger</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Thank you.</p>

<p><i>The</i> MESSENGER goes. LINCOLN <i>stands at the table for a moment; he
rings the bell</i>. HAWKINS <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Hay, please.</p>

<p><i>Hawkins</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>He goes, and a moment later</i> HAY <i>comes in.</i></p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Go to General Scott. Ask him to come to me at once.</p>

<p><i>Hay</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>He goes</i>.</p>

<p>THE CURTAIN FALLS.</p>

<pre><i>The two Chroniclers</i>: You who have gone gathering<br>
  Cornflowers and meadowsweet,<br>
Heard the hazels glancing down<br>
  On September eves,<br>
Seen the homeward rooks on wing<br>
  Over fields of golden wheat,<br>
<br>
And the silver cups that crown<br>
  Water-lily leaves;<br>
<br>
You who know the tenderness<br>
  Of old men at eve-tide,<br>
Coming from the hedgerows,<br>
  Coming from the plough,<br>
And the wandering caress<br>
  Of winds upon the woodside,<br>
When the crying yaffle goes<br>
  Underneath the bough;<br>

<p>SCENE III.</p>

<p><i>Nearly two years later</i>.</p>

<p><i>A small reception room at the White House</i>. MRS. LINCOLN, <i>dressed in a
fashion perhaps a little too considered, despairing as she now does of
any sartorial grace in her husband, and acutely conscious that she must
meet this necessity of office alone, is writing. She rings the bell,
and</i> SUSAN, <i>who has taken her promotion more philosophically, comes in.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: Admit any one who calls, Susan. And enquire whether the
President will be in to tea.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Mr. Lincoln has just sent word that he will be in.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: Very well.</p>

<p>SUSAN <i>is going</i>.</p>

<p>Susan. <i>Susan</i>: Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: You still say Mr. Lincoln. You should say the President.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Yes, ma'am. But you see, ma'am, it's difficult after calling
him Mr. Lincoln for fifteen years.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: But you must remember. Everybody calls him the President
now.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: No, ma'am. There's a good many people call him Father Abraham
now. And there's some that like him even better than that. Only to-day
Mr. Coldpenny, at the stores, said, "Well, Susan, and how 's old Abe
this morning?"</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: I hope you don't encourage them.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Oh, no, ma'am. I always refer to him as Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: Yes, but you must say the President.</p>

<p><i>Susan:</i> I'm afraid I shan't ever learn, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: You must try.</p>


<p><i>Susan</i>: Yes, of course, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: And bring any visitors up.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Yes, ma'am. There's a lady waiting now.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: Then why didn't you say so?</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: That's what I was going to, ma'am, when you began to talk about
Mr.&mdash;I mean the President, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: Well, show her up.</p>

<p>SUSAN <i>goes</i>. MRS. LINCOLN <i>closes her writing desk.</i> SUSAN <i>returns,
showing in</i> MRS. GOLIATH BLOW.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Mrs. Goliath Blow.</p>

<p><i>She goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: Good-afternoon, Mrs. Lincoln.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: Good-afternoon, Mrs. Blow. Sit down, please.</p>

<p><i>They sit</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: And is the dear President well?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: Yes. He's rather tired.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: Of course, to be sure. This dreadful war. But I hope he's
not getting tired of the war.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: It's a constant anxiety for him. He feels his
responsibility very deeply.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: To be sure. But you mustn't let him get war-weary. These
monsters in the South have got to be stamped out.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: I don't think you need be afraid of the President's
firmness.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: Oh, of course not. I was only saying to Goliath yesterday,
"The President will never give way till he has the South squealing," and
Goliath agreed.</p>

<p>SUSAN <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Mrs. Otherly, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: Show Mrs. Otherly in.</p>

<p>SUSAN <i>goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: Oh, that dreadful woman! I believe she wants the war to
stop.</p>

<p><i>Susan (at the door</i>): Mrs. Otherly.</p>


<p>MRS. OTHERLY <i>comes in and</i> SUSAN <i>goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: Good-afternoon, Mrs. Otherly. You know Mrs. Goliath
Blow?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Otherly</i>: Yes. Good-afternoon. <i>She sits</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: Goliath says the war will go on for another three years at
least.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Otherly</i>: Three years? That would be terrible, wouldn't it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: We must be prepared to make sacrifices.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Otherly</i>: Yes.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: It makes my blood boil to think of those people.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Otherly</i>: I used to know a lot of them. Some of them were very
kind and nice.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: That was just their cunning, depend on it. I'm afraid
there's a good deal of disloyalty among us. Shall we see the dear
President this afternoon, Mrs. Lincoln?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>: He will be here directly, I think.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: You 're looking wonderfully well, with all the hard work
that you have to do. I've really had to drop some of mine. And with
expenses going up, it's all very lowering, don't you think? Goliath and
I have had to reduce several of our subscriptions. But, of course, we
all have to deny ourselves something. Ah, good-afternoon, dear Mr.
President.</p>

<p>LINCOLN <i>comes in</i>. THE LADIES <i>rise and shake hands with him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Good-afternoon, ladies.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Otherly</i>: Good-afternoon, Mr. President.</p>

<p><i>They all sit</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: And is there any startling news, Mr. President?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Madam, every morning when I wake up, and say to myself, a
hundred, or two hundred, or a thousand of my countrymen will be killed
to-day, I find it startling.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: Oh, yes, of course, to be sure. But I mean, is there any
good news.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Yes. There is news of a victory. They lost twenty-seven
hundred men&mdash;we lost eight hundred.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: How splendid!</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Thirty-five hundred.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: Oh, but you mustn't talk like that, Mr. President. There
were only eight hundred that mattered.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: The world is larger than your heart, madam.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: Now the dear President is becoming whimsical, Mrs. Lincoln.</p>

<p>SUSAN <i>brings in tea-tray, and hands tea round.</i> LINCOLN <i>takes none</i>.
SUSAN <i>goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Otherly</i>: Mr. President.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Otherly</i>: I don't like to impose upon your hospitality. I know how
difficult everything is for you. But one has to take one's
opportunities. May I ask you a question?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Certainly, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Otherly</i>: Isn't it possible for you to stop this war? In the name
of a suffering country, I ask you that.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: I'm sure such a question would never have entered my head.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: It is a perfectly right question. Ma'am, I have but one
thought always&mdash;how can this thing be stopped? But we must ensure the
integrity of the Union. In two years war has become an hourly bitterness
to me. I believe I suffer no less than any man. But it must be endured.
The cause was a right one two years ago. It is unchanged.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Otherly</i>: I know you are noble and generous. But I believe that
war must be wrong under any circumstances, for any cause.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: I'm afraid the President would have but little
encouragement if he listened often to this kind of talk.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I beg you not to harass yourself, madam. Ma'am, I too believe
war to be wrong. It is the weakness and the jealousy and the folly of
men that make a thing so wrong possible. But we are all weak, and
jealous, and foolish. That's how the world is, ma'am, and we cannot
outstrip the world. Some of the worst of us are sullen, aggressive
still&mdash;just clumsy, greedy pirates. Some of us have grown out of that.
But the best of us have an instinct to resist aggression if it won't
listen to persuasion. You may say it's a wrong instinct. I don't know.
But it's there, and it's there in millions of good men. I don't believe
it's a wrong instinct, I believe that the world must come to wisdom
slowly. It is for us who hate aggression to persuade men always and
earnestly against it, and hope that, little by little, they will hear
us. But in the mean time there will come moments when the aggressors
will force the instinct to resistance to act. Then we must act
earnestly, praying always in our courage that never again will this
thing happen. And then we must turn again, and again, and again to
persuasion. This appeal to force is the misdeed of an imperfect world.
But we are imperfect. We must strive to purify the world, but we must
not think ourselves pure above the world. When I had this thing to
decide, it would have been easy to say, "No, I will have none of it; it
is evil, and I will not touch it." But that would have decided nothing,
and I saw what I believed to be the truth as I now put it to you, ma'am.
It's a forlorn thing for any man to have this responsibility in his
heart. I may see wrongly, but that's how I see.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: I quite agree with you, Mr. President. These brutes in the
South must be taught, though I doubt whether you can teach them anything
except by destroying them. That's what Goliath says.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Goliath must be getting quite an old man.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: Indeed, he's not, Mr. President Goliath is only
thirty-eight.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Really, now? Perhaps I might be able to get him a commission.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: Oh, no. Goliath couldn't be spared. He's doing contracts
for the government, you know. Goliath couldn't possibly go. I'm sure he
will be very pleased when I tell him what you say about these people who
want to stop the war, Mr. President. I hope Mrs. Otherly is satisfied.
Of course, we could all complain. We all have to make sacrifices, as I
told Mrs. Otherly.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Otherly</i>: Thank you, Mr. President, for what you've said. I must
try to think about it. But I always believed war to be wrong. I didn't
want my boy to go, because I believed it to be wrong. But he would. That
came to me last week.</p>

<p><i>She hands a paper to</i> LINCOLN.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (looks at it, rises, and hands it back to her)</i>: Ma'am, there
are times when no man may speak. I grieve for you, I grieve for you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Otherly (rising)</i>: I think I will go. You don't mind my saying
what I did?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: We are all poor creatures, ma'am. Think kindly of me. (<i>He
takes her hand</i>.) Mary.</p>

<p>MRS. LINCOLN <i>goes out with</i> MRS. OTHERLY.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Blow</i>: Of course it's very sad for her, poor woman. But she makes
her trouble worse by these perverted views, doesn't she? And, I hope you
will show no signs of weakening, Mr. President, till it has been made
impossible for those shameful rebels to hold up their heads again.
Goliath says you ought to make a proclamation that no mercy will be
shown to them afterwards. I'm sure I shall never speak to one of them
again.</p>

<p><i>Rising</i>.</p>

<p>Well, I must be going. I'll see Mrs. Lincoln as I go out.
Good-afternoon, Mr. President. <i>She turns at the door, and offers</i>
LINCOLN <i>her handy which he does not take</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Good-afternoon, madam. And I'd like to offer ye a word of
advice. That poor mother told me what she thought. I don't agree with
her, but I honour her. She's wrong, but she is noble. You've told me
what you think. I don't agree with you, and I'm ashamed of you and your
like. You, who have sacrificed nothing, babble about destroying the
South while other people conquer it. I accepted this war with a sick
heart, and I've a heart that's near to breaking every day. I accepted it
in the name of humanity, and just and merciful dealing, and the hope of
love and charity on earth. And you come to me, talking of revenge and
destruction, and malice, and enduring hate. These gentle people are
mistaken, but they are mistaken cleanly, and in a great name. It is you
that dishonour the cause for which we stand&mdash;it is you who would make it
a mean and little thing. Good-afternoon.</p>

<p><i>He opens the door and</i> MRS. BLOW, <i>finding words inadequate, goes</i>.
LINCOLN <i>moves across the room and rings a bell. After a moment,</i> SUSAN
<i>comes in</i>. Susan, if that lady comes here again she may meet with an
accident.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Yes, sir. Is that all, sir?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: No, sir, it is not all, sir. I don't like this coat. I am
going to change it. I shall be back in a minute or two, and if a
gentleman named Mr. William Custis calls, ask him to wait in here.</p>

<p><i>He goes out</i>. SUSAN <i>collects the teacups. As she is going to the door
a quiet, grave white-haired negro appears facing her</i>. SUSAN <i>starts
violently</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Negro (he talks slowly and very quietly)</i>: It is all right.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: And who in the name of night might you be?</p>

<p><i>The Negro</i>: Mista William Custis. Mista Lincoln tell me to come here.
Nobody stop me, so I come to look for him.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Are you Mr. William Custis?</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Yes.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Mr. Lincoln will be here directly. He's gone to change his
coat. You'd better sit down.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Yes.</p>

<p><i>He does so, looking about him with a certain pathetic inquisitiveness</i>.
Mista Lincoln live here. You his servant? A very fine thing for young
girl to be servant to Mista Lincoln.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Well, we get on very well together.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: A very bad thing to be slave in South.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Look here, you Mr. Custis, don't you go mixing me up with
slaves.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: No, you not slave. You servant, but you free body. That very
mighty thing. A poor servant, born free.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Yes, but look here, are you pitying me, with your poor servant?</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Pity? No. I think you very mighty.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Well, I don't know so much about mighty. But I expect you're
right. It isn't every one that rises to the White House.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: It not every one that is free body. That is why you mighty.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: I've never thought much about it.</p>

<p><i>Custis:</i> I think always about it.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: I suppose you're free, aren't you?</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Yes. Not born free. I was beaten when I a little nigger. I saw
my mother&mdash;I will not remember what I saw.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: I'm sorry, Mr. Custis. That was wrong.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Yes. Wrong.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Are all nig&mdash;I mean are all black gentlemen like you?</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: No. I have advantages. They not many have advantages.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: No, I suppose not. Here's Mr. Lincoln coming.</p>

<p>LINCOLN, <i>coated after his heart's desire, comes to the door</i>. CUSTIS
<i>rises</i>. This is the gentleman you said, sir.</p>

<p><i>She goes out with the tray.</i></p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Mr. Custis, I'm very glad to see you. <i>He offers his hand</i>.
CUSTIS <i>takes it, and is about to kiss it</i>. LINCOLN <i>stops him gently.
(Sitting):</i> Sit down, will you? <i>Custis (still standing, keeping his hat
in his hand):</i> It very kind of Mista Lincoln ask me to come to see him.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I was afraid you might refuse.</p>

<p><i>Custis:</i> A little shy? Yes. But so much to ask Glad to come.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Please sit down.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Polite?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Please. I can't sit myself, you see, if you don't.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Black, black. White, white.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Nonsense. Just two old men, sitting together (CUSTIS <i>sits
to</i> LINCOLN'S <i>gesture</i>)&mdash;and talking.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: I think I older man than Mista Lincoln.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Yes, I expect you are, I'm fifty-four.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: I seventy-two.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I hope I shall look as young when I'm seventy-two.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Cold water. Much walk. Believe in Lord Jesus Christ. Have
always little herbs learnt when a little nigger. Mista Lincoln try. Very
good.</p>

<p><i>He hands a small twist of paper to</i> LINCOLN.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Now, that's uncommon kind of you. Thank you. I've heard much
about your preaching, Mr. Custis.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Yes.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I should like to hear you.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Mista Lincoln great friend of my people.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I have come at length to a decision.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: A decision?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Slavery is going. We have been resolved always to confine it.
Now it shall be abolished.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: You sure?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Sure.</p>

<p>CUSTIS <i>slowly stands up, bows his head, and sits again</i>.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: My people much to learn. Years, and years, and years.
Ignorant, frightened, suspicious people. It will be difficult, very
slow. (<i>With growing passion</i>.) But born free bodies. Free. I born
slave, Mista Lincoln. No man understand who not born slave.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Yes, yes. I understand.</p>

<p><i>Custis (with his normal regularity)</i>: I think so. Yes.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I should like you to ask me any question you wish.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: I have some complaint. Perhaps I not understand.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Tell me.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Southern soldiers take some black men prisoner. Black men in
your uniform. Take them prisoner. Then murder them.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I know.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: What you do?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: We have sent a protest.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: No good. Must do more.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: What more can we do?</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: You know.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Yes; but don't ask me for reprisals.</p>

<p><i>Custis (gleaming)</i>: Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: No, no. You must think. Think what you are saying.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: I think of murdered black men.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You would not ask me to murder?</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Punish&mdash;not murder.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Yes, murder. How can I kill men in cold blood for what has
been done by others? Think what would follow. It is for us to set a
great example, not to follow a wicked one. You do believe that, don't
you?</p>

<p><i>Custis (after a pause)</i>: I know. Yes. Let your light so shine before
men. I trust Mista Lincoln. Will trust. I was wrong. I was too sorry for
my people.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Will you remember this? For more than two years I have
thought of you every day. I have grown a weary man with thinking. But I
shall not forget. I promise that.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: You great, kind friend. I will love you.</p>

<p><i>A knock at the door.</i></p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Yes.</p>

<p>SUSAN <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: An officer gentleman. He says it's very important.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I'll come.</p>

<p><i>He and</i> CUSTIS <i>rise</i>.</p>

<p>Wait, will you, Mr. Custis? I want to ask you some questions.</p>

<p><i>He goes out. It is getting dark, and</i> SUSAN <i>lights a lamp and draws
the curtains</i>. CUSTIS <i>stands by the door looking after</i> LINCOLN.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: He very good man.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: You've found that out, have you?</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Do you love him, you white girl?</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: Of course I do.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Yes, you must.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: He's a real white man. No offence, of course.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Not offend. He talk to me as if black no difference.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: But I tell you what, Mr. Custis. He'll kill himself over this
war, his heart's that kind&mdash;like a shorn lamb, as they say.</p>

<p><i>Custis</i>: Very unhappy war.</p>

<p><i>Susan</i>: But I suppose he's right. It's got to go on till it's settled.</p>

<p><i>In the street below a body of people is heard approaching, singing
"John Brown's Body</i>" CUSTIS <i>and</i> SUSAN <i>stand listening</i>, SUSAN
<i>joining in the song as it passes and fades away.</i></p>

<p>THE CURTAIN FALLS.</p>

<pre><i>First Chronicler</i>: Unchanged our time. And further yet<br>
In loneliness must be the way,<br>
And difficult and deep the debt<br>
Of constancy to pay.<br>

<p>SCENE IV.</p>

<p><i>About the same date. A meeting of the Cabinet at Washington</i>. SMITH
<i>has gone and</i> CAMERON <i>has been replaced by</i> EDWIN M. STANTON,
<i>Secretary of War. Otherwise the ministry, completed by</i> SEWARD, CHASE,
HOOK, BLAIR, <i>and</i> WELLES, <i>is as before. They are now arranging
themselves at the table, leaving</i> LINCOLN'S <i>place empty.</i></p>

<p>Seward (<i>coming in</i>): I've just had my summons. Is there some special
news?</p>

<p><i>Stanton</i>: Yes. McClellan has defeated Lee at Antietam. It's our
greatest success. They ought not to recover from it. The tide is
turning.</p>

<p><i>Blair</i>: Have you seen the President?</p>

<p><i>Stanton</i>: I've just been with him.</p>

<p><i>Welles</i>: What does he say?</p>

<p><i>Stanton</i>: He only said, "At last." He's coming directly.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: He will bring up his proclamation again. In my opinion it is
inopportune.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Well, we've learnt by now that the President is the best man
among us.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: There's a good deal of feeling against him everywhere, I find.</p>

<p><i>Blair</i>: He's the one man with character enough for this business.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: There are other opinions.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Yes, but not here, surely.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: It's not for me to say. But I ask you, what does he mean about
emancipation? I've always understood that it was the Union we were
fighting for, and that abolition was to be kept in our minds for
legislation at the right moment. And now one day he talks as though
emancipation were his only concern, and the next as though he would
throw up the whole idea, if by doing it he could secure peace with the
establishment of the Union. Where are we?</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: No, you're wrong. It's the Union first now with him, but
there's no question about his views on slavery. You know that perfectly
well. But he has always kept his policy about slavery free in his mind,
to be directed as he thought best for the sake of the Union. You
remember his words: "If I could save the Union without freeing any
slaves, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves,
I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others
alone, I would also do that. My paramount object in this struggle is to
save the Union." Nothing could be plainer than that, just as nothing
could be plainer than his determination to free the slaves when he can.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Well, there are some who would have acted differently.</p>

<p><i>Blair</i>: And you may depend upon it they would not have acted so wisely.</p>

<p><i>Stanton</i>: I don't altogether agree with the President. But he's the
only man I should agree with at all.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: To issue the proclamation now, and that's what he will propose,
mark my words, will be to confuse the public mind just when we want to
keep it clear.</p>

<p><i>Welles</i>: Are you sure he will propose to issue it now?</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: You see if he doesn't.</p>

<p><i>Welles</i>: If he does I shall support him.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Is Lee's army broken?</p>

<p><i>Stanton</i>: Not yet&mdash;but it is in grave danger.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Why doesn't the President come? One would think this news was
nothing.</p>

<p><i>Chase</i>: I must say I'm anxious to know what he has to say about it all.</p>

<p>A CLERK <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i>: The President's compliments, and he will be here in a moment.</p>

<p><i>He goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: I shall oppose it if it comes up.</p>

<p><i>Chase</i>: He may say nothing about it.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: I think he will.</p>

<p><i>Stanton</i>: Anyhow, it's the critical moment.</p>

<p><i>Blair</i>: Here he comes.</p>

<p>LINCOLN <i>comes in carrying a small book</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Good-morning, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>He takes his place</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Ministers</i>: Good-morning, Mr. President.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: Great news, we hear.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: If we leave things with the army to take their course for a
little now, we ought to see through our difficulties.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: It's an exciting morning, gentlemen. I feel rather excited
myself. I find my mind not at its best in excitement. Will you allow me?</p>

<p><i>Opening his book</i>.</p>

<p>It may compose us all. It is Mr. Artemus Ward's latest.</p>

<p>THE MINISTERS, <i>with the exception of</i> HOOK, <i>who makes no attempt to
hide his irritation, and</i> STANTON, <i>who would do the same but for his
disapproval of</i> HOOK, <i>listen with good-humoured patience and amusement
while he reads the following passage from Artemus Ward</i>.</p>

<p>"High Handed Outrage at Utica."</p>

<p>"In the Faul of 1856, I showed my show in Utiky, a trooly grate city in
the State of New York. The people gave me a cordyal recepshun. The press
was loud in her prases. 1 day as I was givin a descripshun of my Beests
and Snaiks in my usual flowry stile what was my skorn and disgust to see
a big burly feller walk up to the cage containin my wax figgers of the
Lord's last Supper, and cease Judas Iscarrot by the feet and drag him
out on the ground. He then commenced fur to pound him as hard as he
cood."</p>

<p>"'What under the son are you abowt,' cried I."</p>

<p>"Sez he, 'What did you bring this pussylanermus cuss here fur?' and he
hit the wax figger another tremenjis blow on the bed."</p>

<p>"Sez I, 'You egrejus ass, that airs a wax figger&mdash;a representashun of
the false 'Postle.'"</p>

<p>"Sez he, 'That's all very well fur you to say; but I tell you, old man,
that Judas Iscarrot can't show himself in Utiky with impunerty by a darn
site,' with which observashun he kaved in Judassis hed. The young man
belonged to 1 of the first famerlies in Utiky. I sood him, and the Joory
brawt in a verdick of Arson in the 3d degree."</p>

<p><i>Stanton</i>: May we now consider affairs of state?</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Yes, we may.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Mr. Hook says, yes, we may.</p>

<p><i>Stanton</i>: Thank you.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Oh, no. Thank Mr. Hook.</p>

<p><i>Seward</i>: McClellan is in pursuit of Lee, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You suppose a good deal. But for the first time McClellan has
the chance of being in pursuit of Lee, and that's the first sign of
their end. If McClellan doesn't take his chance, we'll move Grant down
to the job. That will mean delay, but no matter. The mastery has changed
hands.</p>

<p><i>Blair</i>: Grant drinks.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Then tell me the name of his brand. I'll send some barrels to
the others. He wins victories.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Is there other business?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: There is. Some weeks ago I showed you a draft I made
proclaiming freedom for all slaves.</p>

<p><i>Hook (aside to Welles</i>): I told you so.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You thought then it was not the time to issue it. I agreed. I
think the moment has come. May I read it to you again? "It is proclaimed
that on the first day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any
state, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United
States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free." That allows
three months from to-day. There are clauses dealing with compensation in
a separate draft.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: I must oppose the issue of such a proclamation at this moment in
the most unqualified terms. This question should be left until our
victory is complete. To thrust it forward now would be to invite
dissension when we most need unity.</p>

<p><i>Welles</i>: I do not quite understand, Mr. President, why you think this
the precise moment.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Believe me, gentlemen, I have considered this matter with all
the earnestness and understanding of which I am capable.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: But when the "New York Tribune" urged you to come forward with a
clear declaration six months ago, you rebuked them.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Because I thought the occasion not the right one. It was
useless to issue a proclamation that might be as inoperative as the
Pope's bull against the comet. My duty, it has seemed to me, has been to
be loyal to a principle, and not to betray it by expressing it in action
at the wrong time. That is what I conceive statesmanship to be. For long
now I have had two fixed resolves. To preserve the Union, and to abolish
slavery. How to preserve the Union I was always clear, and more than two
years of bitterness have not dulled my vision. We have fought for the
Union, and we are now winning for the Union. When and how to proclaim
abolition I have all this time been uncertain. I am uncertain no longer.
A few weeks ago I saw that, too, clearly. So soon, I said to myself, as
the rebel army shall be driven out of Maryland, and it becomes plain to
the world that victory is assured to us in the end, the time will have
come to announce that with that victory and a vindicated Union will come
abolition. I made the promise to myself&mdash;and to my Maker. The rebel army
is now driven out, and I am going to fulfil that promise. I do not wish
your advice about the main matter, for that I have determined for
myself. This I say without intending anything but respect for any one of
you. But I beg you to stand with me in this thing.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: In my opinion, it's altogether too impetuous.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: One other observation I will make. I know very well that
others might in this matter, as in others, do better than I can, and if
I was satisfied that the public confidence was more fully possessed by
any one of them than by me, and knew of any constitutional way in which
he could be put in my place, he should have it. I would gladly yield it
to him. But, though I cannot claim undivided confidence, I do not know
that, all things considered, any other person has more; and, however
this may be, there is no way in which I can have any other man put where
I am. I am here; I must do the best I can, and bear the responsibility
of taking the course which I feel I ought to take.</p>

<p><i>Stanton</i>: Could this be left over a short time for consideration?</p>

<p><i>Chase</i>: I feel that we should remember that our only public cause at
the moment is the preservation of the Union.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: I entirely agree.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Gentlemen, we cannot escape history. We of this
administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal
significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. In giving
freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free. We shall nobly save
or meanly lose the last, best hope on earth.</p>

<p><i>He places the proclamation in front of him</i>.</p>

<p>"Shall be thenceforward and forever free."</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I pray for your support.</p>

<p><i>He signs it</i>.</p>

<p>THE MINISTERS <i>rise</i>. SEWARD, WELLES, <i>and</i> BLAIR <i>shake</i> LINCOLN'S
<i>hand and go out</i>. STANTON <i>and</i> CHASE <i>bow to him, and follow</i>. HOOK,
<i>the last to rise, moves away, making no sign.</i></p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Hook.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Hook, one cannot help hearing things.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: I beg your pardon?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Hook, there's a way some people have, when a man says a
disagreeable thing, of asking him to repeat it, hoping to embarrass him.
It's often effective. But I'm not easily embarrassed. I said one cannot
help hearing things.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: And I do not understand what you mean, Mr. President.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Come, Hook, we're alone. Lincoln is a good enough name. And I
think you understand.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: How should I?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Then, plainly, there are intrigues going on.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Against the government?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: No. In it. Against me.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Criticism, perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: To what end? To better my ways?</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: I presume that might be the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Then, why am I not told what it is?</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: I imagine it's a natural compunction.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Or ambition?</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You think you ought to be in my place.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: You are well informed.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You cannot imagine why every one does not see that you ought
to be in my place.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: By what right do you say that?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Is it not true?</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: You take me unprepared. You have me at a disadvantage.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You speak as a very scrupulous man, Hook.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Do you question my honour?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: As you will.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Then I resign.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: As a protest against ...?</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Your suspicion.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: It is false?</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Very well, I will be frank. I mistrust your judgment.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: In what?</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: Generally. You over-emphasise abolition.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You don't mean that. You mean that you fear possible public
feeling against abolition.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: It must be persuaded, not forced.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: All the most worthy elements in it are persuaded. But the
ungenerous elements make the most noise, and you hear them only. You
will run from the terrible name of Abolitionist even when it is
pronounced by worthless creatures whom you know you have every reason to
despise.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: You have, in my opinion, failed in necessary firmness in saying
what will be the individual penalties of rebellion.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: This is a war. I will not allow it to become a blood-feud.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: We are fighting treason. We must meet it with severity.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: We will defeat treason. And I will meet it with conciliation.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: It is a policy of weakness.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: It is a policy of faith&mdash;it is a policy of compassion.
<i>(Warmly</i>.) Hook, why do you plague me with these jealousies? Once
before I found a member of my Cabinet working behind my back. But he was
disinterested, and he made amends nobly. But, Hook, you have allowed the
burden of these days to sour you. I know it all. I've watched you
plotting and plotting for authority. And I, who am a lonely man, have
been sick at heart. So great is the task God has given to my hand, and
so few are my days, and my deepest hunger is always for loyalty in my
own house. You have withheld it from me. You have done great service in
your office, but you have grown envious. Now you resign, as you did once
before when I came openly to you in friendship. And you think that again
I shall flatter you and coax you to stay. I don't think I ought to do
it. I will not do it. I must take you at your word.</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: I am content.</p>

<p><i>He turns to go</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Will you shake hands?</p>

<p><i>Hook</i>: I beg you will excuse me.</p>

<p><i>He goes</i>. LINCOLN <i>stands silently for a moment, a travelled, lonely
captain. He rings a bell, and a</i> CLERK <i>comes in.</i></p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Ask Mr. Hay to come in.</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>He goes</i>. LINCOLN, <i>from the folds of his pockets, produces another
book, and holds it unopened</i>. HAY <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I'm rather tired to-day, Hay. Read to me a little. (<i>He hands
him the book</i>.) "The Tempest"&mdash;you know the passage.</p>

<p><i>Hay (reading)</i>:</p>

<pre>  Our revels now are ended; these our actors,<br>
  As I foretold you, were all spirits, and<br>

  The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,<br>
  The solemn temples, the great globe itself,<br>
  Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve<br>
  And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,<br>
  Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff<br>
  As dreams are made on, and our little life<br>

<i>The two together</i>: What victor coming from the field<br>
  Leaving the victim desolate,<br>
But has a vulnerable shield<br>
  Against the substances of fate?<br>
That battle's won that leads in chains<br>
  But retribution and despite,<br>
And bids misfortune count her gains<br>
  Not stricken in a penal night.<br>
<br>
His triumph is but bitterness<br>
  Who looks not to the starry doom<br>
When proud and humble but possess<br>
  The little kingdom of the tomb.<br>
<br>
Who, striking home, shall not forgive,<br>
  Strikes with a weak returning rod,<br>
Claiming a fond prerogative<br>
  Against the armoury of God.<br>
<br>
Who knows, and for his knowledge stands<br>
  Against the darkness in dispute,<br>
And dedicates industrious hands,<br>
  And keeps a spirit resolute,<br>
Prevailing in the battle, then<br>
  A steward of his word is made,<br>
To bring it honour among men,<br>
  Or know his captaincy betrayed.<br>

<p>SCENE V.</p>


<p><i>An April evening in 1865. A farmhouse near Appomattox</i>. GENERAL GRANT,
<i>Commander-in-Chief, under Lincoln, of the Northern armies, is seated at
a table with</i> CAPTAIN MALINS, <i>an aide-de-camp. He is smoking a cigar,
and at intervals he replenishes his glass of whiskey</i>. DENNIS, <i>an
orderly, sits at a table in the corner, writing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grant (consulting a large watch lying in front of him</i>): An hour and a
half. There ought to be something more from Meade by now. Dennis.</p>

<p><i>Dennis (coming to the table</i>): Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Take these papers to Captain Templeman, and ask Colonel West if
the twenty-third are in action yet. Tell the cook to send some soup at
ten o'clock. Say it was cold yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Dennis</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>He goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Give me that map, Malins.</p>

<p>MALINS <i>hands him the map at which he is working</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>After studying it in silence</i>): Yes. There's no doubt about it. Unless
Meade goes to sleep it can only be a question of hours. Lee's a great
man, but he can't get out of that.</p>

<p><i>Making a ring on the map with his finger</i>.</p>

<p><i>Malins (taking the map again</i>): This ought to be the end, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Yes. If Lee surrenders, we can all pack up for home.</p>

<p><i>Malins</i>: By God, sir, it will be splendid, won't it, to be back again?</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: By God, sir, it will.</p>

<p><i>Malins</i>: I beg your pardon, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: You're quite right, Malins. My boy goes away to school next
week. Now I may be able to go down with him and see him settled.</p>

<p>DENNIS <i>comes back</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dennis</i>: Colonel West says, yes, sir, for the last half-hour. The cook
says he's sorry, sir. It was a mistake.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Tell him to keep his mistakes in the kitchen.</p>

<p><i>Dennis</i>: I will, sir.</p>

<p><i>He goes back to his place.</i></p>

<p>Grant (<i>at his papers</i>): Those rifles went up this afternoon?</p>

<p><i>Malins</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Another</i> ORDERLY <i>comes in.</i></p>

<p><i>Orderly</i>: Mr. Lincoln has just arrived, sir. He's in the yard now.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: All right, I'll come.</p>

<p>THE ORDERLY <i>goes</i>. GRANT <i>rises and crosses to the door, but is met
there by</i> LINCOLN <i>and</i> HAY. LINCOLN, <i>in top boots and tall hat that
has seen many campaigns, shakes hands with</i> GRANT <i>and takes</i> MALINS'S
<i>salute</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grant:</i> I wasn't expecting you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: No; but I couldn't keep away. How's it going?</p>

<p><i>They sit</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Meade sent word an hour and a half ago that Lee was surrounded
all but two miles, which was closing in.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: That ought about to settle it, eh?</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Unless anything goes wrong in those two miles, sir. I'm
expecting a further report from Meade every minute.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Would there be more fighting?</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: It will probably mean fighting through the night, more or less.
But Lee must realise it's hopeless by the morning.</p>

<p><i>An Orderly (entering)</i>: A despatch, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Yes.</p>

<p>THE ORDERLY <i>goes, and a</i> YOUNG OFFICER <i>comes in from the field. He
salutes and hands a despatch to</i> GRANT.</p>

<p><i>Officer</i>: From General Meade, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant (taking it</i>): Thank you.</p>

<p><i>He opens it and reads</i>.</p>

<p>You needn't wait.</p>

<p>THE OFFICER <i>salutes and goes</i>.</p>

<p>Yes, they've closed the ring. Meade gives them ten hours. It's timed at
eight. That's six o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p><i>He hands the despatch to</i> LINCOLN.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: We must be merciful. Bob Lee has been a gallant fellow.</p>

<p><i>Grant (taking a paper</i>): Perhaps you'll look through this list, sir. I
hope it's the last we shall have.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (taking the paper</i>): It's a horrible part of the business,
Grant. Any shootings?</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: One.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Damn it, Grant, why can't you do without it? No, no, of
course not? Who is it?</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Malins.</p>

<p><i>Malins (opening a book</i>): William Scott, sir. It's rather a hard case.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: What is it?</p>

<p><i>Malins</i>: He had just done a heavy march, sir, and volunteered for
double guard duty to relieve a sick friend. He was found asleep at his
post.</p>

<p><i>He shuts the book</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: I was anxious to spare him. But it couldn't be done. It was a
critical place, at a gravely critical time.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: When is it to be?</p>

<p><i>Matins</i>: To-morrow, at daybreak, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I don't see that it will do him any good to be shot. Where is
he?</p>

<p><i>Malins</i>: Here, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Can I go and see him?</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Where is he?</p>

<p><i>Malins</i>: In the barn, I believe, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Dennis.</p>

<p><i>Dennis (coming from his table</i>): Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Ask them to bring Scott in here.</p>

<p>DENNIS <i>goes</i>.</p>

<p>I want to see Colonel West. Malins, ask Templeman if those figures are
ready yet.</p>

<p><i>He goes, and</i> MALINS <i>follows.</i></p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Will you, Hay?</p>

<p>HAY <i>goes. After a moment, during which</i> LINCOLN <i>takes the book that</i>
MALINS <i>has been reading from, and looks into it</i>, WILLIAM SCOTT <i>is
brought in under guard. He is a boy of twenty</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (to the</i> GUARD): Thank you. Wait outside, will you?</p>

<p><i>The</i> MEN <i>salute and withdraw</i>.</p>

<p>Are you William Scott?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You know who I am?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: The General tells me you've been court-martialled.</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Yes sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Asleep on guard?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: It's a very serious offence.</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: I know, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: What was it?</p>

<p><i>Scott (a pause</i>): I couldn't keep awake, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You'd had a long march?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Twenty-three miles, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You were doing double guard?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Who ordered you?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Well, sir, I offered.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Why?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Enoch White&mdash;he was sick, sir. We come from the same place.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Where's that?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Vermont, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You live there?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Yes, sir. My ... we've got a farm down there, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Who has?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: My mother, sir. I've got her photograph, sir.</p>

<p><i>He takes it from his pocket</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (taking it</i>): Does she know about this?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: For God's sake, don't, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: There, there, my boy. You're not going to be shot.</p>

<p><i>Scott (after a pause</i>): Not going to be shot, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: No, no.</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Not&mdash;going&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;shot.</p>

<p><i>He breaks down, sobbing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (rising and going to him</i>): There, there. I believe you when
you tell me that you couldn't keep awake. I'm going to trust you, and
send you back to your regiment.</p>

<p><i>He goes back to his seat.</i></p>

<p><i>Scott:</i> When may I go back, sir?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: You can go back to-morrow. I expect the fighting will be
over, though.</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Is it over yet, sir?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Not quite.</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Please, sir, let me go back to-night&mdash;let me go back to-night.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Very well.</p>

<p><i>He writes</i>.</p>

<p>Do you know where General Meade is?</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: No, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Ask one of those men to come here.</p>

<p>SCOTT <i>calls one of his guards in.</i></p>

<p><i>Lincoln:</i> Your prisoner is discharged. Take him at once to General Meade
with this.</p>

<p><i>He hands a note to the man.</i></p>

<p><i>The Soldier</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>: Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><i>He salutes and goes out with the</i> SOLDIER.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Hay.</p>

<p><i>Hay (outside</i>): Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>He comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: What's the time?</p>

<p><i>Hay (looking at the watch on the table</i>): Just on half-past nine, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I shall sleep here for a little. You'd better shake down too.
They'll wake us if there's any news.</p>

<p>LINCOLN <i>wraps himself up on two chairs</i>.</p>

<p>HAY <i>follows suit on a bench. After a few moments</i> GRANT <i>comes to the
door, sees what has happened, blows out the candles quietly, and goes
away</i>.</p>

<p>THE CURTAIN FALLS.</p>

<pre><i>The First Chronicler</i>: Under the stars an end is made,
And on the field the Southern blade
Lies broken,
And, where strife was, shall union be,
And, where was bondage, liberty.
The word is spoken....
Night passes.
</pre>

<p><i>The Curtain rises on the same scene</i>, LINCOLN <i>and</i> HAY <i>still lying
asleep. The light of dawn fills the room. The</i> ORDERLY <i>comes in with
two smoking cups of coffee and some biscuits</i>. LINCOLN <i>wakes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Good-morning.</p>

<p><i>Orderly</i>: Good-morning, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (taking coffee and biscuits</i>): Thank you.</p>

<p><i>The</i> ORDERLY <i>turns to</i> HAY, <i>who sleeps on, and he hesitates</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Hay. <i>(Shouting</i>.) Hay.</p>

<p><i>Hay (starting up</i>): Hullo! What the devil is it? I beg your pardon,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Not at all. Take a little coffee.</p>

<p><i>Hay</i>: Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><i>He takes coffee and biscuits. The</i> ORDERLY <i>goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Slept well, Hay?</p>

<p><i>Hay</i>: I feel a little crumpled, sir. I think I fell off once.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: What's the time?</p>

<p><i>Hay (looking at the watch</i>): Six o'clock, sir.</p>

<p>GRANT <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Good-morning, sir; good-morning, Hay.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Good-morning, general.</p>

<p><i>Hay</i>: Good-morning, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: I didn't disturb you last night. A message has just come from
Meade. Lee asked for an armistice at four o'clock.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (after a silence</i>): For four years life has been but the hope
of this moment. It is strange how simple it is when it comes. Grant,
you've served the country very truly. And you've made my work possible.</p>

<p><i>He takes his hand</i>.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Had I failed, the fault would not have been yours, sir. I
succeeded because you believed in me.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Where is Lee?</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: He's coming here. Meade should arrive directly.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Where will Lee wait?</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: There's a room ready for him. Will you receive him, sir?</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: No, no, Grant. That's your affair. You are to mention no
political matters. Be generous. But I needn't say that.</p>

<p><i>Grant (taking a paper from his pocket</i>): Those are the terms I suggest.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln (reading):</i> Yes, yes. They do you honour.</p>

<p><i>He places the paper on the table. An</i> ORDERLY <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Orderly</i>: General Meade is here, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Ask him to come here.</p>

<p><i>Orderly</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>He goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: I learnt a good deal from Robert Lee in early days. He's a
better man than most of us. This business will go pretty near the heart,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: I'm glad it's to be done by a brave gentleman, Grant.</p>

<p>GENERAL MEADE <i>and</i> CAPTAIN SONE, <i>his aide-de-camp, come in</i>. MEADE
<i>salutes. Lincoln</i>: Congratulations, Meade. You've done well.</p>

<p><i>Meade</i>: Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Was there much more fighting?</p>

<p><i>Meade</i>: Pretty hot for an hour or two.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: How long will Lee be?</p>

<p><i>Meade</i>: Only a few minutes, I should say, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: You said nothing about terms?</p>

<p><i>Meade</i>: No, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Did a boy Scott come to you?</p>

<p><i>Meade</i>: Yes, sir. He went into action at once. He was killed, wasn't
he, Sone?</p>

<p><i>Sone</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: Killed? It's a queer world, Grant.</p>

<p><i>Meade</i>: Is there any proclamation to be made, sir, about the rebels?</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: No, no. I'll have nothing of hanging or shooting these men,
even the worst of them. Frighten them out of the country, open the
gates, let down the bars, scare them off. Shoo!</p>

<p><i>He flings out his arms</i>.</p>

<p>Good-bye, Grant. Report at Washington as soon as you can.</p>

<p><i>He shakes hands with him</i>.</p>

<p>Good-bye, gentlemen. Come along, Hay.</p>

<p>MEADE <i>salutes and</i> LINCOLN <i>goes, followed by</i> HAY.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Who is with Lee?</p>

<p><i>Meade</i>: Only one of his staff, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: You might see Malins, will you, Sone, and let us know directly
General Lee comes.</p>

<p><i>Sone</i>: Yes, sir. <i>He goes out</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Well, Meade, it's been a big job.</p>

<p><i>Meade</i>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: We've had courage and determination. And we've had wits, to
beat a great soldier. I'd say that to any man. But it's Abraham Lincoln,
Meade, who has kept us a great cause clean to fight for. It does a man's
heart good to know he's given victory to such a man to handle. A glass,
Meade? <i>(Pouring out whiskey</i>.) No? <i>(Drinking</i>.)</p>

<p>Do you know, Meade, there were fools who wanted me to oppose Lincoln for
the next Presidency. I've got my vanities, but I know better than that.</p>

<p>MALINS <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Malins</i>: General Lee is here, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Meade, will General Lee do me the honour of meeting me here?</p>

<p>MEADE <i>salutes and goes</i>.</p>

<p>Where the deuce is my hat, Malins? And sword.</p>

<p><i>Malins</i>: Here, sir.</p>

<p>MALINS <i>gets them for him</i>. MEADE <i>and</i> SONE <i>come in, and stand by the
door at attention</i>. ROBERT LEE, <i>General-in-Chief of the Confederate
forces, comes in, followed by one of his staff. The days of critical
anxiety through which he has just lived have marked themselves on</i> LEE'S
<i>face, but his groomed and punctilious toilet contrasts pointedly with</i>
GRANT'S <i>unconsidered appearance. The two commanders face each other</i>.
GRANT <i>salutes, and</i> LEE <i>replies.</i></p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: Sir, you have given me occasion to be proud of my opponent.</p>

<p><i>Lee</i>: I have not spared my strength. I acknowledge its defeat.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: You have come&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lee</i>: To ask upon what terms you will accept surrender. Yes.</p>

<p><i>Grant (taking the paper from the table and handing it to</i> LEE): They
are simple. I hope you will not find them ungenerous.</p>

<p><i>Lee (having read the terms</i>): You are magnanimous, sir. May I make one
submission?</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: It would be a privilege if I could consider it.</p>

<p><i>Lee</i>: You allow our officers to keep their horses. That is gracious.
Our cavalry troopers' horses also are their own.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: I understand. They will be needed on the farms. It shall be
done.</p>

<p><i>Lee</i>: I thank you. It will do much towards conciliating our people. I
accept your terms.</p>

<p>LEE <i>unbuckles his sword, and offers it to</i> GRANT.</p>

<p><i>Grant</i>: No, no. I should have included that. It has but one rightful
place. I beg you.</p>

<p>LEE <i>replaces his sword</i>. GRANT <i>offers his hand and</i> LEE <i>takes it.
They salute, and</i> LEE <i>turns to go</i>.</p>

<p>THE CURTAIN FALLS.</p>

<pre><i>The two Chroniclers</i>: A wind blows in the night,<br>
And the pride of the rose is gone.<br>
It laboured, and was delight,<br>
And rains fell, and shone<br>
Suns of the summer days,<br>
<br>
And dews washed the bud,<br>
And thanksgiving and praise<br>
Was the rose in our blood.<br>
<br>
And out of the night it came,<br>
A wind, and the rose fell,<br>
Shattered its heart of flame,<br>
And how shall June tell<br>
The glory that went with May?<br>
How shall the full year keep<br>
The beauty that ere its day<br>
Was blasted into sleep?<br>
<br>
Roses. Oh, heart of man:<br>
Courage, that in the prime<br>
Looked on truth, and began<br>
Conspiracies with time<br>
To flower upon the pain<br>
Of dark and envious earth....<br>
A wind blows, and the brain<br>
Is the dust that was its birth.<br>
<br>
What shall the witness cry,<br>
He who has seen alone<br>
With imagination's eye<br>
The darkness overthrown?<br>
Hark: from the long eclipse<br>
The wise words come&mdash;<br>
A wind blows, and the lips<br>
Of prophecy are dumb.<br>

<p>SCENE VI.</p>

<p><i>The evening of April</i> 14, 1865. <i>The small lounge of a theatre. On the
far side are the doors of three private boxes. There is silence for a
few moments. Then the sound of applause comes from the auditorium
beyond. The box doors are opened. In the centre box can be seen</i> LINCOLN
<i>and</i> STANTON, MRS. LINCOLN, <i>another lady, and an officer, talking
together.</i></p>

<p><i>The occupants come out from the other boxes into the lounge, where small
knots of people have gathered from different directions, and stand or
sit talking busily</i>.</p>

<p><i>A Lady</i>: Very amusing, don't you think?</p>

<p><i>Her Companion</i>: Oh, yes. But it's hardly true to life, is it?</p>

<p><i>Another Lady</i>: Isn't that dark girl clever? What's her name?</p>

<p><i>A Gentleman (consulting his programme</i>:) Eleanor Crowne.</p>

<p><i>Another Gentleman</i>: There's a terrible draught, isn't there? I shall
have a stiff neck.</p>

<p><i>His Wife</i>: You should keep your scarf on.</p>

<p><i>The Gentleman</i>: It looks so odd.</p>

<p><i>Another Lady</i>: The President looks very happy this evening, doesn't he?</p>

<p><i>Another</i>: No wonder, is it? He must be a proud man.</p>

<p><i>A young man, dressed in black, passes among the people, glancing
furtively into</i> LINCOLN'S <i>box, and disappears. It is</i> JOHN WILKES
BOOTH.</p>

<p><i>A Lady (greeting another</i>): Ah, Mrs. Bennington. When do you expect
your husband back?</p>

<p><i>They drift away</i>. SUSAN, <i>carrying cloaks and wraps, comes in. She goes
to the box, and speaks to</i> MRS. LINCOLN. <i>Then she comes away, and sits
down apart from the crowd to wait.</i></p>

<p><i>A Young Man</i>: I rather think of going on the stage myself. My friends
tell me I'm uncommon good. Only I don't think my health would stand it.</p>

<p><i>A Girl</i>: Oh, it must be a very easy life. Just acting&mdash;that's easy
enough.</p>

<p><i>A cry of</i> "Lincoln" <i>comes through the auditorium. It is taken up, with
shouts of</i> "The President," "Speech," "Abraham Lincoln," "Father
Abraham," <i>and so on. The conversation in the lounge stops as the
talkers turn to listen. After a few moments</i>, LINCOLN <i>is seen to rise.
There is a burst of cheering. The people in the lounge stand round the
box door</i>. LINCOLN <i>holds up his hand, and there is a sudden silence</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln</i>: My friends, I am touched, deeply touched, by this mark of
your good-will. After four dark and difficult years, we have achieved
the great purpose for which we set out. General Lee's surrender to
General Grant leaves but one Confederate force in the field, and the end
is immediate and certain. <i>(Cheers</i>.) I have but little to say at this
moment. I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that
events have controlled me. But as events have come before me, I have
seen them always with one faith. We have preserved the American Union,
and we have abolished a great wrong. <i>(Cheers</i>.) The task of
reconciliation, of setting order where there is now confusion, of
bringing about a settlement at once just and merciful, and of directing
the life of a reunited country into prosperous channels of good-will and
generosity, will demand all our wisdom, all our loyalty. It is the
proudest hope of my life that I may be of some service in this work.
<i>(Cheers</i>.) Whatever it may be, it can be but little in return for all
the kindness and forbearance that I have received. With malice toward
none, with charity for all, it is for us to resolve that this nation,
under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the
people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

<p><i>There is a great sound of cheering. It dies down, and a boy passes
through the lounge and calls out</i> "Last act, ladies and gentlemen." <i>The
people disperse, and the box doors are closed</i>. SUSAN <i>is left alone and
there is silence</i>.</p>

<p><i>After a few moments</i>, BOOTH <i>appears. He watches</i> SUSAN <i>and sees that
her gaze is fixed away from him. He creeps along to the centre box and
disengages a hand from under his cloak. It holds a revolver. Poising
himself, he opens the door with a swift movement, fires, flings the door
to again, and rushes away. The door is thrown open again, and the</i>
OFFICER <i>follows in pursuit. Inside the box</i>, MRS. LINCOLN <i>is kneeling

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
